PROJECT : PYTHON PROGRAMMING ON SIMPLE CALCULATOR

OBJECTIVE :The objective of the Python program is to implement a basic calculator that prompts the user to input two numbers and select an arithmetic operation. It performs the chosen operation (addition, 
          subtraction, multiplication, or division) and displays the result. The program handles user input and displays the result in a user-friendly manner.
KEY ACTIVITIES :
  1. Prompt the user to enter two numerical values.
  2. Ask the user to choose an arithmetic operation: addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.
 3. Perform the selected operation on the input numbers.
 4. Display the result of the calculation to the user.
TECHNOLOGIES USED :
1. Python programming language is used for implementing the calculator logic.
2. Basic input and output functions (input(), print()) handle user interaction.
3. Arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /) perform the mathematical operations.
4. Conditional statements (if, elif, else) control the flow based on user input.
